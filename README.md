Stage 2 of Google Mobile Web Development

## Project Overview Stage 2

**Restaurant Reviews** projects, this started with a static unresponsive webpage then converting it to a accessible & responsive mobile-friendly web application.
In **Stage One**, the webpage was redesigned to be responsive to different screen displays while aslo making it usable for screen readers by adding **ARIA** lables. 
**Stage Two** builds on the previous stage by adding resources to pull **JSON** from the server while making the response available offline by adding serviceworkers.
